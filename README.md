# kurt-stefan-bridge-bidding

This is a page about the bridge bidding I and my bridge partner Stefan uses.

[mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is used to generate the documentation.

Thus the doc is written in markdown.
I have made a [preprocessor](https://github.com/kurteklund/mdbook-bridge-preprocessor) so I can edit the suit colors.

The doc is also written in swedish!
So this repo have limited usage for non swedish people

The resulting html/css/javascript doc can be viewed at: <https://kurteklund.github.io/kurt-stefan-bridge-bidding/>
